  <div class="about">
  	<p>My name is Jared Krause. I am a street and travel photographer from Canada. I love photography, capturing candid moments, visiting photography galleries in Toronto, and collecting an increasingly large number of photography books.</p>
  	<p>I make photos with two cameras, an Olympus OMD EM-5 with a few prime lenses, and my iPhone. I regularly post my iPhone photos to <a href="http://instagram.com/kravse" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
  	<p>I am a web developer currently working in Toronto. This blog was one of my recent projects. I rebuild it often, every time I want to learn something new. For inquiries feel free to contact me or connect with me on <a href="http://github.com/kravse" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
